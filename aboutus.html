<h3 id = 'textInAboutUs'>What We've Learned As Part of Google Cohort</h3>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>Through the OFA internship program, the Google Tech Cohort interns were presented informational sessions on various projects, roles, and divisions currently found at Google. From learning about software development and business analytics to social impact projects and data centers, I gained both unexpected and valuable knowledge hearing from Google employees’ stories and advice. In one specific session on measurements and analytics, a Googler conducted an interactive session going through industry vocabulary, useful skills, and an analyst activity to highlight sample trends and problems regularly handled. Another session covered the communications and public affairs division at Google, where three Googlers shared details about the importance of their work, their day-to-day work routines, and the challenges they face. It was intriguing to hear startups under Google and Googlers’ side-projects come to life and make an impact. I looked forward to each session as each one was a different and unique topic!</q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>I learned a lot during these sessions with Google. I use Google everyday, and I always wondered, what goes behind making Google? Everytime I search something, it brings up millions of results. Attending these Google sessions helps me understand how Google works. Workers also share out their personal stories of how they ended up at Google and how they chose their career which inspires me to work hard.</q>

    <q>The Google session that stuck out the most to me was the google.org session. I learned how much Google was helping the communities that they were a part of by providing support for local charities and fundraisers. Furthermore, I liked the fact that Google is pushing to support people with dealing with social issues by helping spread awareness through their sites like Google.org.</q>

    <q>The Google sessions this summer have been a real learning experience for me, especially the sessions with developers and engineers from different divisions in Google. It is my interest as a computer science student to enter the industry where Google is one of the leading figures. I enjoyed learning and discussing the career path and experience within Google, and I appreciated all the time and efforts from the google employees that came out and discussed their role and experience with all of us. I learned a lot of what it means to be a Googler and had a better understanding of what I need to do in order to proceed in my own career.</q>

    <q>The meeting that stood out to me the most was the Google.org meeting. It was one of our first meetings and is probably the one I remember the most. It was really an eye opener for the things that happen behind the trillion dollar company. It was nice to see that there was a whole division focused on helping the community and investing in local companies. </q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>During the Google sessions, I learned about the many positions that are available at Google. There were sessions that would have a number of people talk about the events they were able to be a part of because of their position, like the people from Google maps and the person who used coding in order to find exact information of the snowboarder’s measurements in the air. There were also sessions where the presenters would give us pointers on what employers look for when hiring someone, which was very useful information. In conclusion, Google sessions were very informative and very helpful to get more of an understanding of the many positions available at the Google company.</q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>Google sessions have been so informative about Google jobs and Google’s purpose. They have many jobs that range from coding to public speaking. They have such a variety of jobs that I wouldn’t have known about otherwise. Also, they talk about the importance of each job that comes back to the purpose of Google. </q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>Throughout the Google sessions, I learned a lot about both the technical and non-technical sides of Google. It opened my eyes to the many different careers that one can have while working at this company and that Google isn’t just a company filled with engineers. There are so many aspects going on behind the scenes at Google to make the company as functional and successful as it is.</q>

    <q>When I first got into OFA I was unsure in what career field I would like to work in. Thanks to the Google sessions it has solidified my choice in working in the tech field with it’s various career opportunities. Without the Google sessions and OFA I would still be questioning my future goals.</q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>During the Google sessions, we were able to learn about employees in different Google departments and gain insight on how they go to where they are. I liked that they showcased a diverse set of jobs and backgrounds. It was also interesting to see what services Google provides outside of their search engine, like investment in the community, self-driving cars, and their shopping service. </q>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>My time participating in the Google sessions listening in on presentations was pretty good. There are a broad spectrum of different jobs that were provided at Google. Learning of everyone’s personal experience and seeing that everyone started on a different path was really informative and inspirational. My personal favorite presentation was about Google’s Waymo. Seeing a startup company’s growth, of the company starting from getting a Toyota car to getting to a self-built car, was amazing to see, as we could clearly see the vast amount of change in just a few years. The presenter was also really interactive in asking questions to the audience. The portion where he showed interview questions that they ask was really useful so we could get an idea of what we would expect if we were to apply.</q>

     <p>Rebecca Zumaeta is a rising senior at San Francisco State University majoring in Computer Science. She is a San Francisco native and has lived here all her life. Rebecca started her career in computer science at the start of college so she has only had about 3 years of coding experience, but it has opened many doors for her. She was able to be a Lab Manager for the Computer Science Department at SFSU and had been a part of two internship programs, Project Pull and OFA. The Project Pull internship gave Rebecca the opportunity to work at the Public Utilities Commission in their IT department. This experience allowed the possibility to continue interning this summer.  COVID19 brought that possibility to an end but OFA didn’t.  The OFA internship has been with the intuitive and smart Tech- Google Cohort. On a more personal note, Rebecca enjoys coding her personal website that one can view <a href="https://rezum.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>, creating art (digitally and manually), spending time with friends and family, watching movies, play video games and enjoys cuddling with her three dogs. Rebecca plans to keep growing her knowledge of coding languages and perfect her skills but also likes to learn and spread awareness of social justice issues such as the Black Lives Matter Movement and inequality of genders in Computer Science positions and education. </p>
